# Template p5 project

exercise: Make some noise

point:
1. I wanna my user can interact with user object(movement or state) with their mic  (idealy)
(brush in the drawing simulation, for example use music to control the brush presure to draw )
2. warning at dangerous place/situation with Oscillator (may be uesd in project 2)
3. make sounds effect or bgm with oscillator and PolySynth  (classic self made effct in final project)

problem:
1. unexpected bug when check of collision(can not be defined in Isaac class)  (same method worked before)
(ask on next class studio)
2. the firefox can not detect my audioin and fire fox will detect the PolySynth as audioIN?  IDK why (need be fix)
