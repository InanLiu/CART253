artist statement
The idea of extending the concept of painting
Personally, I like drawing. Although I am not good at drawing. Drawing is a very happy thing. When I ask myself what is "painting"?  Painting is the way we expanded our thinking on the operation tools. Drawing with a pen on paper is the traditional way of painting. However, nowadays, many people use a mouse or a Wacom to draw pictures on electronic devices. It is true that many artists are no longer in touch with paper painting. They are better equipped with better "weapons" to complete the colorful work in their mind.Obviously, the concept of painting is gradually expanding, and it can be assumed that traditional paint may become less and less popular. Just like many operas today. Just as it is hard for us to imagine what inkstick is like, the Next-generation may not know how to sharpen a pencil.  while the tools never stop changing, painting, a natural human activity, doesn't. I think the reason why we humans are so passionate about painting is that we are inherently creative, and painting is a wonderful way to create your own work. I made a tool try to provide more eaier stage for people to feel the beautiful of painting. In case, good traditional painting need millons of exercrise but code drawing just need  infinite "for loop". With p5 this library to write the dynamic painting system need to consider more picture of the whole dynamic feeling. The dynamic painting broad can let user easily paint a beautiful picture in few secends. The dynamic painting broad with high brightness brush can let users easily paint a beautiful picture in a few seconds. What I want is that users can get the feeling of "look, I just made an amazing art piece" and feel the beauty of painting and colorful world. I did even not include any words to describe the tools but only images. I want my users to try and experience. During the experience, they will discover they already make great pictures.


I made more than three visions of structures and the comprehensive structure cost ton of hours to try out and debug. It is like the roller coaster, the suffering during the debugging will finally transfer to pleasant when its success.
